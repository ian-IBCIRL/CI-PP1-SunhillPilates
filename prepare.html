        Pilates is a form of exercise that focuses on building core strength and is suitable for all fitness
        levels. It's also a professional, client-centered practice. A friendly and knowledgeable staff person should
        greet you at any studio you visit.

        To get answers to your questions, most Pilates studios will allow you to attend class on a drop-in (pay by the
        class) basis. Your instructor will explain things to you, but it helps to be prepared for what to expect.

        It can be daunting to walk into a Pilates studio for the first time. 
        A quick glance around may reveal a variety of intimidating, even scary-looking, contraptions. 
        You might find yourself wondering how your body could possibly engage with them.
        <br><br>
        <h4>What to Bring to a Pilates Class</h4>
        You won’t need to bring much with you to a class, as Pilates studios usually provide equipment for the workout.
        The exception would be a mat if you would prefer to use your own rather than a shared one from class.
        You'll still want to have water available and make sure that you're well-hydrated before class starts.
        <br><br>
        <h4>What to Wear</h4>
        Most Pilates studios are casual, but the norms vary. 
        Keep your attire simple (at least at first) while you figure out what works best for you. 
        
        Tame your mane. If your hair is long, make sure it's tied back out of your face.

        Think form-fitting, not baggy. Choose workout clothing that's stretchy but not baggy. Your instructor needs to
        see the alignment of your bones and how your muscles are engaging.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Mat Work and Equipment</h4>
        Pilates workouts are based either on Pilates mat work (which is done on the floor with a minimum of equipment)
        or on Pilates apparatus (i.e., those aforementioned contraptions).

        If you're a Pilates beginner, mat work is a great place to start.
        The fundamental movements and Pilates exercise principles are incorporated into the mat exercises.

        Mat exercises will help you gain strength and confidence in the Pilates method.

        In addition to being adaptable to any fitness level, Pilates mat exercises let you focus on learning the basics
        correctly without having to master new exercise equipment at the same time.
        <br><br>
        <h4>Etiquette for Pilates Classes—Dos and Dont's</h4>
        Do arrive on time.

        Do let your instructor know about injuries or bodily changes. Instructors will check in with students before
        class to see how they're feeling. 
        
        If you have a concern, don't wait to be asked. Before class starts, politely approach the instructor and let them know if you have a minor worry or a more significant issue like surgery, pregnancy,
        neck pain, or back pain.
