<h1 align="center">Sunhill Pilates Website</h1>

Welcome to my Code Institute Portfolio Project 1 covering HTML and CSS - Website for Sunhill Pilates.

See here for the current website: https://ian-ibcirl.github.io/CI-PP1-SunhillPilates/

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type: `python3 -m http.server`

Sunhill Pilates is a site that advertises and informs the audience about a fictitious fitness business. The business primarily sells classroom Pilates instruction and also a limited range of smaller classes for one to four people. The site is targeted toward people who want to learn Pilates and commit to their exercise on an ongoing basis. Sunhill Pilates also provides a small number of introductory classes and informational videos for clients and visitors "on the go" or at home. The business also has regular classes with informal gatherings afterwards, for anyone who wants to stay and socialise. People are just getting used to social gatherings again, especially among older clients who may not have the circle of friends from the past. The primary USP is the appeal, satisfaction and quality of the instruction. The site will be useful for people who want to check out the range of classes available, the location and classroom hours, as well as the references of the instructors.

This file also contains some important information about the project, including Gitpod and the extensions we use. 

The last update to this file was: **15th July 2022**

## Features
* [Back to index](#index) 
* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 


### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has an initial consistent look and placement on the main page, with all three pages (when completed) of the website ready to support easy navigation.  As well as the initial Home page, the site will include a simple Logo, Classes and Contact links and should be responsive on multiple screen sizes.  For smaller screens, such mobile devices, the Home, Classes and Contact links move to under the Logo.

- __Fxy Footer__

    - The footer will be featured on all three pages and will be identical on each page making it easy to use.  It will contain three sections :

        - Class Times - by putting the class times in the footer on each page allows the user to quickly and easily find this information and begin planning their participation.

        - Address - the address of this business is important to the user in order for them to plan their use of the services, and get some idea of the quality of the facility and surrounding location for parking etc..

        - Contact Us - links to social media sites associated with the instructor and the training organisation make it easy for the user to keep connected, and see who else is participating.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. Sunhill Pilates is a ficticious company, so the links currently just go to the social media main websites for now.

        - Return Home - the footer also has a link to go back to the top of the current page for ease and speed of navigation back to the top.

- __How the features correlate with the User Stories__

    - The User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document are numbered and categorised into groups A (first time visitor), B (returning visitor) and C (frequent visitor).  The existing features are listed above as F01 to F0X ** CHANGE FOR PUSH.  The chart below shows how the user stories correlate to features, showing features that support the user stories.

### Future Features 
* [Back to index](#index) 
* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 

- __Timeline__
    - A 'Timeline' page could be added to provide more information experience and certification of the instructor(s) for clients who would like to know more about the origins of the business, its values and its interaction with the community.

- __Video Playback__
    - A 'Video Playback' page could be added to provide further sample videos and actual class content for clients on the go or working from home or under lockdown. Some content would only be accessible to registered clients with a current subscription.

- __Privacy/Security__
    - A 'Security' page could be added to provide commonly expected assurances to clients. Some content would only be accessible to registered clients with a current subscription, so it would eventually me necessary to collect more identifying information for legitimate use cases, as expected by GDPR and other related legislation, in various jurisdictions. All subsequent information sent to the client will have the option to opt out, delete personally identifiable information, access account information for a subject access request, and delete the account on request.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The functionality of the navigation bar will be extended to make it available to the user without scrolling.
    - A 'Contact via Whatsapp' option or QR code may also be helpful.


## Design
* [Back to index](#index) 
* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 

-   ### Imagery
    -   I am working to find images to choose that will be eye-catching, informative and bright.  The colours in the images will be chosen to help convey a sense of mindfulness, health and wellbeing. The images will show Pilates participants to align with the main business goal of selling Pilates classes. They will be chosen to ensure the site is clear and easy to use.

    - Social media icon images from https://github.com/techtycho/microsoft-homepage-clone/tree/master/img

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A palette will be chosen to convey a mindful and healthy mood. An image of the palette will be added here.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts are being used to import Oswald fonts into assests\css\style.css. 

-   ### Wireframes

## Data Privacy
## FAQ about our data collection
* [Back to index](#index) 
* [Back to top of README.md](#about-my-project) 

I would add something like the following to a security/privacy page for the site.

"We are very aware of concerns around GDPR and data privacy and protection, so want you to know we understand the concerns and have worked hard to address those too. Our staff come from a medical health care background and so ensure comprehensive client confidentiality."

**Why do we have data collection?**

It will help us to calculate how many Pilates classes there should be at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. 
It will help us decide on the future direction of our services.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of our site, it doesn’t have any effect at all. 

The site only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the site is loaded.
- The current date and time
- The page status of “started” or “in-use”, which is sent every 5 minutes.
- Any other data we may add to the site logic to further provide services to you.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. 

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Initially no personally identifiable information is being captured, but we'd appreciate it if you let us do so (for "legitimate use" cases only), in due course; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply close the web page and the data will not be retained.

**Anything more?**

Not at this time. :-)
